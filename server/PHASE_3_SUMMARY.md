# Phase 3 Implementation Summary: Bidding, Scoring & Tests

## Overview

Successfully completed Phase 3 of the server implementation, adding:
1. **Complete bidding phase system** with coinche/surcoinche
2. **Full scoring calculation** with all bonuses and penalties
3. **Comprehensive test suite** including Socket.IO integration tests

**All 67 tests passing ✓**

## What Was Implemented

### 1. Bidding Phase System (`src/rules/bidding.ts`)

Complete auction system according to `specs/rules.md`:

#### Features
- **Minimum bid**: 80 points
- **Contract types**: clubs, diamonds, hearts, spades, no-trump, all-trump
- **Priority hierarchy**: clubs < diamonds < hearts < spades < no-trump < all-trump
- **Coinche (double)**: Opponents can double the contract
- **Surcoinche (redouble)**: Bidding team can redouble after coinche
- **Passing logic**: 3 passes after bid ends auction, 4 passes without bid triggers redeal
- **Auction end**: Coinche/surcoinche ends bidding immediately

#### Functions Exported
```typescript
- isValidBid(bid, state): Validates if a bid is legal
- canCoinche(playerId, state, turnOrder): Checks if player can coinche
- canSurcoinche(playerId, state, turnOrder): Checks if player can surcoinche
- processBid(bid, state): Processes a bid action
- processPass(playerId, state): Processes a pass action
- processCoinche(playerId, state, turnOrder): Processes coinche
- processSurcoinche(playerId, state, turnOrder): Processes surcoinche
- createInitialBiddingState(): Creates initial state
- getWinningTeam(winningBid, turnOrder): Determines winning team
```

#### Bidding State
```typescript
interface BiddingState {
  currentBid: Bid | null;
  coinched: boolean;
  coinchedBy: string | null;
  surcoinched: boolean;
  passes: number;
  bids: Bid[];
  status: 'active' | 'ended' | 'redeal';
  winningBid: Bid | null;
}
```

### 2. Scoring Calculation System (`src/rules/scoring.ts`)

Complete scoring system with all rules from specs:

#### Features
- **Card point values**: Correct trump vs non-trump values
- **Belote/Rebelote**: 20 points for K+Q of trump
- **Dix de der**: 10 bonus points for last trick
- **Capot**: 250 points for declaring team, 500 for defenders
- **Contract fulfillment**: Checks if declaring team met contract value
- **Failed contract penalty**: 160 points to defenders
- **Coinche multipliers**: x2 for coinche, x4 for surcoinche
- **Rounding**: Scores rounded to nearest 10
- **Game end detection**: Checks if team reached 1000 points

#### Functions Exported
```typescript
- calculateTrickPoints(cards, contractType): Calculate points in a trick
- checkBeloteAnnouncement(tricks, contractType, turnOrder): Detect belote
- calculateRoundScore(tricks, contractType, turnOrder): Sum up round totals
- calculateContractResult(roundScore, declaringTeam, ...): Final scores with multipliers
- isGameOver(teamAScore, teamBScore, targetScore): Check game end
```

#### Scoring Flow
```
1. Sum card points by team from all tricks
2. Add Belote/Rebelote (20 points) if applicable
3. Add dix de der (10 points) to last trick winner
4. Handle capot (250 or 500 points)
5. Check contract fulfillment
6. Apply failed contract penalty if needed (160 points)
7. Apply coinche/surcoinche multipliers (x2 or x4)
8. Round to nearest 10
```

### 3. Socket.IO Integration Tests (`tests/socket.spec.ts`)

Complete test suite for WebSocket functionality:

#### Test Coverage (10 tests)
- ✓ Connection with dev token
- ✓ Connection without token (anonymous)
- ✓ Heartbeat reception
- ✓ Join room channel
- ✓ Receive room:player_joined event
- ✓ Receive room:player_left event
- ✓ Join game channel
- ✓ Leave game channel
- ✓ Error handling for non-existent room
- ✓ Error handling for non-existent game

#### Test Setup
```typescript
- Uses socket.io-client for testing
- Creates isolated HTTP server per test
- Tests multi-client scenarios
- Verifies event broadcasting
- Tests acknowledgement callbacks
```

### 4. Bidding System Tests (`tests/bidding.spec.ts`)

Comprehensive bidding logic tests (30 tests):

#### Test Coverage
- ✓ Valid bid acceptance (minimum 80, higher values, priority)
- ✓ Invalid bid rejection (below minimum, lower priority, after coinche)
- ✓ Coinche validation (opponent only, not same team, requires active bid)
- ✓ Surcoinche validation (bidding team only, requires coinche)
- ✓ Bid processing (state updates, pass reset)
- ✓ Pass processing (increment, redeal after 4, auction end after 3)
- ✓ Coinche processing (immediate auction end)
- ✓ Surcoinche processing (immediate auction end)
- ✓ Team determination (teamA vs teamB)

### 5. Scoring System Tests (`tests/scoring.spec.ts`)

Complete scoring calculation tests (20 tests):

#### Test Coverage
- ✓ Trump card values (J=20, 9=14, A=11, 10=10, K=4, Q=3)
- ✓ Non-trump card values (A=11, 10=10, K=4, Q=3, J=2)
- ✓ All-trump contract handling
- ✓ No-trump contract handling
- ✓ Round score calculation (points by team, trick counts)
- ✓ Capot detection (all tricks by one team)
- ✓ Dix de der assignment
- ✓ Contract fulfillment checking
- ✓ Failed contract penalty (160 points)
- ✓ Coinche multiplier (x2)
- ✓ Surcoinche multiplier (x4)
- ✓ Capot by declaring team (250 points)
- ✓ Capot by defenders (500 points)
- ✓ Belote/Rebelote bonus (20 points)
- ✓ Game end detection (1000 points target)

## Example Usage

### Bidding Phase

```typescript
import { 
  createInitialBiddingState, 
  processBid, 
  processPass,
  processCoinche 
} from './rules/bidding';

// Start bidding
let state = createInitialBiddingState();

// Player 1 bids 80 spades
state = processBid({
  playerId: 'player1',
  contractType: 'spades',
  value: 80,
  timestamp: new Date().toISOString()
}, state);

// Player 2 passes
state = processPass('player2', state);

// Player 3 coinches
state = processCoinche('player3', state, turnOrder);

// Auction ended, state.status === 'ended'
console.log(state.winningBid); // { playerId: 'player1', contractType: 'spades', value: 80 }
console.log(state.coinched); // true
```

### Scoring Calculation

```typescript
import { 
  calculateRoundScore, 
  calculateContractResult 
} from './rules/scoring';

// Calculate round totals
const roundScore = calculateRoundScore(tricks, 'spades', turnOrder);

// Calculate final scores with contract
const result = calculateContractResult(
  roundScore,
  'teamA',      // declaring team
  80,           // contract value
  'spades',     // contract type
  true,         // coinched
  false         // surcoinched
);

console.log(result.fulfilled);   // true/false
console.log(result.teamAScore);  // Final score with multipliers
console.log(result.teamBScore);  // Final score with multipliers
```

### Socket.IO Testing

```typescript
import { io } from 'socket.io-client';

const socket = io('http://localhost:3001', {
  auth: { token: 'dev-user-player1' }
});

// Test room join
socket.emit('room:join', 'room_123', (response) => {
  expect(response.ok).toBe(true);
});

// Test event reception
socket.on('room:updated', (data) => {
  console.log('Room updated:', data);
});
```

## What's Still Pending

### Integration with Game Service
The bidding and scoring modules are complete but not yet integrated into the game service. Next steps:

1. **Add bidding phase to game flow**:
   - Start bidding before dealing cards
   - Track bidding state in game entity
   - Emit bidding events via Socket.IO
   - REST endpoints for bid/pass/coinche/surcoinche

2. **Add scoring to game completion**:
   - Calculate scores when all tricks played
   - Track cumulative scores across rounds
   - Detect game end (1000 points)
   - Emit scoring events

3. **Belote/Rebelote tracking**:
   - Detect K+Q of trump played by same team
   - Add announcement mechanism
   - Include in scoring

### Other Pending Features
- Production OAuth integration

   - REST endpoints for bidding actions
   - Socket.IO events for bid updates

2. **Integrate scoring into game service**
   - Calculate scores after each round
   - Track cumulative scores
   - Detect game end

3. **Add more integration tests**
   - Full game flow with bidding
   - Multi-round games
   - Scoring edge cases

4. **Performance testing**
   - Load testing with many concurrent games
   - WebSocket connection limits
   - Memory usage under load

## Summary

Phase 3 successfully adds:
- ✅ Complete bidding phase system (30 tests)
- ✅ Full scoring calculation (20 tests)
- ✅ Socket.IO integration tests (10 tests)
- ✅ All 67 tests passing
- ✅ Comprehensive documentation

The server now has all the core game logic implemented and thoroughly tested. The next phase will integrate bidding and scoring into the game service to create a complete playable coinche game.
