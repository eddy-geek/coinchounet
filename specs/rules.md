# Coinche (Belote Coinchée) Rules

## Overview
Coinche, also called Belote Coinchée, is a French trick-taking card game played by four players in fixed partnerships. Partners sit opposite each other and use a 32-card French-suited deck (A, 10, K, Q, J, 9, 8, 7 in each suit). The objective is to fulfill a contract by scoring more points than the opposing team within each deal while racing to an agreed victory total, commonly 1 000 points.

## Setup
- **Players and seating**: Four players form two teams; partners sit opposite at the table.
- **Deck**: 32-card deck; card ranking varies between trump and non-trump suits.
- **Dealer**: Selected randomly for the first hand, then rotates clockwise. The player to dealer’s right cuts the deck.
- **Dealing**: Cards are distributed clockwise in three packets (3–2–3 or 3–3–2) so each player receives eight cards.

## Card Ranking and Values
- **Trump suit**: J (20), 9 (14), A (11), 10 (10), K (4), Q (3), 8 (0), 7 (0).
- **Non-trump suits**: A (11), 10 (10), K (4), Q (3), J (2), 9 (0), 8 (0), 7 (0).
- **All-trump contract**: Every suit uses the trump ranking/values; 9s are high-value, Js are highest.
- **No-trump contract**: All suits use non-trump ranking/values.

## Bidding Phase
1. **Purpose**: To select the contract specifying the trump (or no/all-trump) and a target score. Bidding starts with the player left of the dealer and continues clockwise.
2. **Minimum bid**: 80 points. Each bid names a trump option and a point value (e.g., “Spades 90”). Bids must increase the point value or change to a higher-ranked contract.
3. **Trump options** (from lowest to highest priority at equal values): Clubs, Diamonds, Hearts, Spades, No-trump, All-trump.
4. **Passing**: A player may pass. Three consecutive passes after a bid end the auction; four passes without a bid trigger a redeal by the next dealer.
5. **Coinche**: An opponent pair may “coinche” (double) an active bid if it is their turn to bid. A coinched contract is worth double points.
6. **Surcoinche**: The bidding team may “surcoinche” (redouble) after being coinched, quadrupling the contract’s value.
7. **Announcements after Coinche**: Once coinche/surcoinche occurs, bidding ends immediately.
8. **Final contract**: The last standing bid becomes the contract; the bidding team becomes the declaring side.

## Gameplay Phase
1. **Leading**: Player left of the dealer leads the first trick unless otherwise specified by local rules.
2. **Following suit**: Players must follow the suit led if possible.
3. **Trumping**: If unable to follow suit, a player must play a trump card. If trumps have been led, they must overtrump if possible; otherwise, any trump may be played. If a player’s partner is currently winning the trick, they may discard any card. If trump have been led, all players must overtrump if possible or play trump otherwise.
4. **Belote/Rebelote**: Holding the King and Queen of trump allows the player to announce “Belote” when playing one and “Rebelote” when playing the other, scoring 20 points. Announcement must occur at the moment the card is played.
5. **Trick winner**: Highest card of the led suit wins unless trumped; if trumped, highest trump wins. Trick winner leads the next trick.
6. **Last trick bonus**: The team winning the final trick earns 10 bonus points (called « dix de der »).

## Scoring
- **Contract fulfillment**: Declaring team sums card points plus Belote/Rebelote and dix de der. If they reach or exceed the contract value, they score their total, and the defenders score their card points.
- **Failed contract**: If the declaring team fails, all trick points (including dix de der) go to defenders. The defenders also score a 160-point bonus (or the contract value, per local rule).
- **Coinche effects**: Doubled contracts multiply all points (including bonuses and penalties) by 2; surcoinche multiplies by 4.
- **Capot**: Winning all tricks (capot) by the declaring side awards 250 points (adjusted by doubles). Defenders achieving capot score 500 points under many rules.
- **General (Generale)**: Some play awards 1 000 points for winning all tricks while being the contracting team; clarify before play.
- **Rounding**: Totals are typically rounded to the nearest 10 (scores ending in 5 round up). Keep cumulative team scores across deals.
- **Game end**: Standard target is 1 000 points; alternative targets or timed sessions can be agreed before play.

## Optional and House Rules
- **Redeal conditions**: Redeal if any player is dealt four 7s or four 8s.
 
- **Contract hierarchy**: Some groups treat No-trump higher than All-trump or allow equal precedence; confirm the convention.
- **Scoring variants**: Clarify whether defenders score their card points when the contract succeeds, or only the declarers’ total is recorded.
- **Penalties**: Establish penalties for revokes (failing to follow suit when possible) or misdeals, often awarding the deal to opponents or applying point deductions.
- **Winner score only the contract**: The winner scores only the contract, not the card points. Losers don't score anything.

## Glossary
- **Coincher**: Doubled contract announced by opponents.
- **Surcoincher**: Redouble made by declarers after a coinche.
- **Capot**: Winning all eight tricks.
- **Dix de der**: Bonus for taking the last trick.
- **Belote/Rebelote**: 20-point bonus for holding and sequentially playing the King and Queen of trump.
